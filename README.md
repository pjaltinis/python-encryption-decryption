These python scripts were used as part of my bootCon Final Project for my Cybersecurity Bootcamp. My project was on Encryption and Decryption with Python. These scripts used python to automate the use of Steganography to hide secret messages and scripts into images and also Fernet encryption/decryption scripts to ensure the message could not be read without a key. Feel free to use these scripts as a template for your projects.
